This is a resume website that I will be fulfilling over time. 
So far it only has HTML and CSS, but I will be adding some Javascript features to it once I've learned the programming language some more!
Please stay tuned.

Headsup update #1: I will add an 'Experience' section into the resume site.

Update #2: I have recently realized that my website does not render the elements where they should be on a Chrome and Internet Explorer when using a Windows computer. It has seemed to work fine on my Macbook in Chrome. Please have this in mind when viewing. Thank you.
